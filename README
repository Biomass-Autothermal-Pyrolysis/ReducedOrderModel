Description
-----------

The ROM function takes the biomass biochemical composition as input and returns 
the primary pyrolysis products in a dictionary. An example of the implementation 
is shown below 


Example code:

# import the pyrolysis function from unit_operator.
>>> from unit_operator import *                    

# Change directory to path that contains the models. 
>>> os.chdir(r"C:\Users\lumed\Desktop\OSTI\models")

# The list containing the biochemical composition of the biomass
>>> biomass = [0.39,0.23,0.15,0.14,0.09]                    

>>> pyrolysis_ROM(biomass)
